Stepper - Step through your JavaScript programs
===============================================

Experiment that's goal is to try to make it easier for people to learn how to program.

### Run it (The easy way)

Open index.html in Firefox.

### Run it (The hard way)

Load chrome enabling passing the harmony command line flag.

Linux Example:

```shell
google-chrome --js-flags='--harmony'
```

On windows there is a possibility something like the following might work from the start menu (unconfirmed).

```
chrome.exe --js-flags='harmony'
```
